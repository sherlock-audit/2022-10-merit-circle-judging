# Different min and max locked time from what is stated in proposal documentation.

## Summary

Proposal [MIP-19](https://gov.meritcircle.io/t/mip-19-upgrading-to-staking-v2/659) says that V2 pools allow user to lock their tokens from 1 week to 208 weeks ( which is about a year ). However, the code and deploy script allows a different range of value.

## Vulnerability Detail

_maxLockDuration() can be set in constructor and in the deploy [script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/tasks/deploy/full.ts#L47), it is set to 4 years ( even though comment says 1 year ).

`MIN_LOCK_DURATION = 10 minutes` is a constant in the code itself, set to 10 minutes. 

## Impact
The current implementation allows user to deposit from 10 minutes to 4 years, which is vastly different from what is stated in the proposal. This can create confusion for voters and affects the credibility of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either change the proposal documentation to make it clear for users, or change the min and max lock duration in the code.
