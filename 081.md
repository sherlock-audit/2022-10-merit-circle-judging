# Users can still transfer tokens with TimeLockNonTransferablePool by using transferFrom

## Summary
The protocol wants to prevent users from transferring their minted tokens by reverting on calling `transfer()`, but this can be circumvented with `transferFrom()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`TimeLockNonTransferablePool` implements a revert when `transfer()` is called. But user can use `approve()` and `transferFrom()` to circumvent this.

## Impact
I understand from the sponsors that depositors should hold the corresponding tokens so that it can be used for off-chain reward calculations. Unknowing users may transfer away their tokens without knowing this, missing potential rewards.

## Code Snippet

[TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol#L23](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol#L23)
```solidity
    function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal override {
        revert("NON_TRANSFERABLE");
    }
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do an override for `_transferFrom()` as well.
