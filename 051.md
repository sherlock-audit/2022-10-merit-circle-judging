# Unbounded loop in `Timelock.sol` could lead to a griefing/DOS attack

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

### Denial Of Service Attack

Denial-of-service attacks: Attacks that cause DoS are called DoS attacks. The purpose is to disable the computer or network from providing normal service.
## Impact
### Description:
As this array can grow quite large, the transactionâ€™s gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function at all
## Code Snippet
[ curve.push(_curve[i]);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L47-L59)
```
        __BasePool_init(_name, _symbol, _depositToken, _rewardToken, _escrowPool, _escrowPortion, _escrowDuration);
        if (_maxLockDuration < MIN_LOCK_DURATION) {
            revert SmallMaxLockDuration();
        }
        if (_curve.length < 2) {
            revert ShortCurveError();
        }
        for (uint i=0; i < _curve.length; i++) {
            if (_curve[i] > _maxBonus) {
                revert MaxBonusError();
            }
            curve.push(_curve[i]);
        }
        maxBonus = _maxBonus;
        maxLockDuration = _maxLockDuration;
        unit = _maxLockDuration / (curve.length - 1);
    }

```
As of in a section of `deposit()` deposits are getting `push` which basically states all the deposit to stack and the `pop` function is working in the `withdraw()` as 
```
 _burn(_msgSender(), userDeposit.shareAmount);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits and/or adding a remove method to remove elements in the array.
