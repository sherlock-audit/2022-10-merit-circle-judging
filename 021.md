# Too few tokens minted(too many tokens burned) in extendLock function

## Summary
Too few tokens minted(too many tokens burned) in extendLock function
## Vulnerability Detail
When the user increases the lock duration in the extendLock function, the number of tokens minted is the number of tokens that should be minted in the new lock duration minus the number of tokens previously minted.
Consider the following scenario.
If the user locks 1000 deposited tokens, he will get 100 tokens in 2 months, 300 tokens in 3 months, and 800 tokens in 6 months.
If the user locks 1000 deposited tokens for 3 months, the user gets 300 tokens at that time.
After two months, the user decides to add another 5 months to the lock duration, so the new lock duration is 6 months and the user gets 800-300 = 500 tokens.
In total, the user has been locked in for 8 months, but has only received 800 tokens.
I think a better practice would be for the user to get 100 + 800 = 900 tokens.
## Impact
The user gets less tokens than expected when calling the extendLock function

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following gottenAmount to the calculation
```solidity
       gottenAmount = userDeposit.amount * getMultiplier((block.timestamp - userDeposit.start)) / 1e18;
        if (mintAmount + gottenAmount > userDeposit.shareAmount) {
            depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount =  mintAmount;
            _mint(_msgSender(), mintAmount + gottenAmount - userDeposit.shareAmount);
        // If the new amount is less then burn that difference
        } else if (mintAmount + gottenAmount < userDeposit.shareAmount) {
            depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount =  mintAmount;
            _burn(_msgSender(), userDeposit.shareAmount - mintAmount - gottenAmount);
        }
```
