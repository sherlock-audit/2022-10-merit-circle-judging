# Minted amounts may be minted to non receivers

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Merit Circle uses  `deposit amount` safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom throughout the codebase to ensure that Amounts are not transferred to non receivers. However, the initial position mint in amount uses _mint rather than _safeMint and does not check that the receiver accepts deposit amount transfers:
## Impact
If a maker or taker are  unable to receive deposit amount, their options positions may be locked and nontransferable. If the receiving contract does not provide a mechanism for interacting with Merit Circle, they will be unable to exercise their position or withdraw assets.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L105-L106
```
  depositsOf[_receiver].push(Deposit({
            amount: _amount,
            shareAmount: mintAmount,
            start: uint64(block.timestamp),
            end: uint64(block.timestamp) + uint64(duration)
        }));

        _mint(_receiver, mintAmount);
        emit Deposited(_amount, duration, _receiver, _msgSender());
    }

```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L131-L135
```
 function withdraw(uint256 _depositId, address _receiver) external {
        if (_depositId >= depositsOf[_msgSender()].length) {
            revert NonExistingDepositError();
        }
        Deposit memory userDeposit = depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId];
        if (block.timestamp < userDeposit.end) {
            revert TooSoonError();
        }

        // remove Deposit
        depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId] = depositsOf[_msgSender()][depositsOf[_msgSender()].length - 1];
        depositsOf[_msgSender()].pop();

        // burn pool shares
        _burn(_msgSender(), userDeposit.shareAmount);
        
        // return tokens
        depositToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, userDeposit.amount);
        emit Withdrawn(_depositId, _receiver, _msgSender(), userDeposit.amount);
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the `require` check in #_safeMint in your own mint function.
However, note that calling` _safeMint` introduces a reentrancy opportunity! If you make this change, ensure that the mint is treated as an interaction rather than an effect, and consider adding a reentrancy guard
Alternatively, document the design decision to use _mint and the associated risk for end users.
