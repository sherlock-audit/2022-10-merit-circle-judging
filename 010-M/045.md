# Claiming rewards with a pool that has an escrow portion but no escrow pool set will render the escrowed rewards lost

## Summary

When a user claims rewards from a pool that has an escrow portion (a value non-zero) but no escrow pool set (set to `address(0)`), the escrowed rewards will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user can claim rewards with the `BasePool.claimRewards` function. Parts or all of the claimable rewards can be escrowed. The escrowed rewards are sent to the `escrowPool` address. The amount of escrowed rewards are calculated with `escrowPortion / 1e18`. However, if the `escrowPool` address is set to `address(0)` but `escrowPortion` is defined to a non-zero value, the escrowed rewards are lost (this state is possible as there is no appropriate validation in the initializer function).

## Impact

Calculated escrowed rewards are not claimable and will be lost.

## Code Snippet

[base/BasePool.sol#L100-L115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BasePool.sol#L100-L115)

```solidity
function claimRewards(address _receiver) external {
    uint256 rewardAmount = _prepareCollect(_msgSender());
    uint256 escrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount * escrowPortion / 1e18;
    uint256 nonEscrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount - escrowedRewardAmount;

    if(escrowedRewardAmount != 0 && address(escrowPool) != address(0)) {
        escrowPool.deposit(escrowedRewardAmount, escrowDuration, _receiver);
    }

    // ignore dust
    if(nonEscrowedRewardAmount > 1) {
        rewardToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
    }

    emit RewardsClaimed(_msgSender(), _receiver, escrowedRewardAmount, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Consider either one of the following:

- prevent a state of having an escrow portion but no escrow pool set, or
- check for the escrow pool address to be non-zero, otherwise set `nonEscrowedRewardAmount` to `rewardAmount`
