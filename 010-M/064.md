# Insufficient input validation of `escrowPortion` and `escrowPool`

## Summary
There could be a loss of rewards if `escrowPool` and `escrowPortion` are misconfigured.

## Vulnerability Detail
`escrowPortion` determines how much of the rewards should be escrowed to the `escrowPool`. Note that it is possible for the `escrowPool` to be set to the null address. Thus, the `escrowPortion` and `escrowPool` should be checked to be tightly coupled. Specifically, the following condition should hold true: `escrowPortion != 0` => `escrowPool != address(0)`

There is otherwise a loss of rewards: if `escrowPortion` is non-zero, but the pool is set to the null address, `escrowPool.deposit()` will not be called, and the escrowed portion will be unrecoverable from the contract.

## Impact
Rewards are lost if `escrowPortion` is non-zero but the escrow pool address is the zero address.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the constructor, ensure that the escrow pool is non-zero if the escrow portion is non-zero.

```solidity
if (_escrowPortion != 0 && _escrowPool == address(0)) revert EscrowSettingError();
```

Note that if `_escrowPortion` is zero then it doesn't really matter if `_escrowPool` is non-zero; no rewards will be escrowed.
