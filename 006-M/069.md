# Rewards distribution may be frontrun

## Summary
Calls to `distributeRewards()` may be frontrun by deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail
Potential depositors might attempt to frontrun `distributeRewards()` calls so that their deposits can immediately be entitled to rewards, regardless of the lock-up timing. 

To some, the minimum lock duration of 10 minutes might be short enough to frontrun on a regular basis.

## Impact
Dilution of pool rewards.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider increasing the value of `MIN_LOCK_DURATION` to a few hours, or even a day. Use MEV relay when distributing rewards.
