# User can receive more rewards by staking for less duration

## Summary

In function `increaseLock` since shares are minted to the user entered address `receiver`, a user with longer staking duration can input a address with lower duration and get more rewards

## Impact

In `increaseLock`the mint amount is calculated by using the remaining deposit duration of msg.sender, but added to the shareAmount of the receiver.
So a user with longer duration can input a receiver address with same depositId but shorter duration and can withdraw more rewards from receiver account.

## Code Snippet


```
    Deposit memory userDeposit = depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId];

    // Only can extend if it has not expired
    if (block.timestamp >= userDeposit.end) {
        revert DepositExpiredError();
    }

    depositToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _increaseAmount);

    // Multiplier should be according the remaining time to the deposit to end
    uint256 remainingDuration = uint256(userDeposit.end - block.timestamp);

    uint256 mintAmount = _increaseAmount * getMultiplier(remainingDuration) / 1e18;

    depositsOf[_receiver][_depositId].amount += _increaseAmount;
    depositsOf[_receiver][_depositId].shareAmount += mintAmount;

    _mint(_receiver, mintAmount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add require statement `require(_msg.Sender() == _receiver)`
