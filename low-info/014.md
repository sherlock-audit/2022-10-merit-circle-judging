# Protocol doesn't work proper with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
When fee-on-transfer tokens will be used for staking then protocol will lost some funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens may take [fee](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer) when transfer assets. 
This is how `deposit` function works.
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _duration, address _receiver) external override {
        if (_amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmountError();
        }
        // Don't allow locking > maxLockDuration
        uint256 duration = _duration.min(maxLockDuration);
        // Enforce min lockup duration to prevent flash loan or MEV transaction ordering
        duration = duration.max(MIN_LOCK_DURATION);

        depositToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);

        uint256 mintAmount = _amount * getMultiplier(duration) / 1e18;

        depositsOf[_receiver].push(Deposit({
            amount: _amount,
            shareAmount: mintAmount,
            start: uint64(block.timestamp),
            end: uint64(block.timestamp) + uint64(duration)
        }));

        _mint(_receiver, mintAmount);
        emit Deposited(_amount, duration, _receiver, _msgSender());
    }
```

After token transfering it doesn't check how the balance increased. Provided by user `_amount` param is saved to the `Deposit` struct. Also share amount that is minted depends on `_amount` param.

The same is for `increaseLock` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L197-L222).
When user withdraw then saved [amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L133) is transferred back.

## Impact
Protocol calculates more deposited tokens for the depositor. When people will start withdrawing their staked funds some of them can be left without some part. Also protocol mints a bigger share for the depositor.

## Code Snippet
Provided above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check balance before and after sending tokens to the pool. Use the difference as provided amount.
