# Have a proper uuid for deposits identification

## Summary
Deposits IDs are equivalent to their index in the `depositsOf` mapping array, which will change with withdrawals (ie. not fixed).
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit IDs assigned to a deposit changes whenever a withdrawal occurs, leading to potentially confusing information logged in events.

### POC
1. Alice performs 3 deposits.
2. She withdraws the 2nd one (`_depositId = 1`). The last deposit in the array replaces this 2nd one, ie. `_depositId = 2` now takes on `_depositId = 1`.
3. Alice extends the lock duration of the "third" deposit (the one that replaced with the second one). `extendLock()` emits the `LockExtended()` event with `_depositId = 1`.

The core issue here is that deposit IDs are not fixed. Logging information pertaining to these mutable IDs may therefore cause confusion (affecting indexing / subgraph queries).

## Impact
Confusion over information in event logs.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the ID universally unique, that is stored in the `Deposit` struct. Simplest method is to use a global counter `depositId` that increments whenever a new deposit occurs.
