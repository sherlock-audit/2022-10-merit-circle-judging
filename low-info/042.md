# User can't transfer all amount of claimed rewards

## Summary
User can't transfer all amount of claimed rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is developer error in `BasePool.claimRewards` function. It's not possible to transfer value that less then 2. See [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BasePool.sol#L110). That means that when amount `nonEscrowedRewardAmount == 1` it will not be transferred to receiver and receiver will lost it.
## Impact
Receiver lose funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function claimRewards(address _receiver) external {
        uint256 rewardAmount = _prepareCollect(_msgSender());
        uint256 escrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount * escrowPortion / 1e18;
        uint256 nonEscrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount - escrowedRewardAmount;

        if(escrowedRewardAmount != 0 && address(escrowPool) != address(0)) {
            escrowPool.deposit(escrowedRewardAmount, escrowDuration, _receiver);
        }

        // ignore dust
        if(nonEscrowedRewardAmount > 1) {
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
        }

        emit RewardsClaimed(_msgSender(), _receiver, escrowedRewardAmount, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change check condition to `if(nonEscrowedRewardAmount > 0)`.
