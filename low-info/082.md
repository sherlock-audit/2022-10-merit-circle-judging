# Deposit and Reward token should be different

## Summary

During the code review, It has been noticed that There is no check If the rewardToken and depositToken are same. During the initialization, If the deployer makes a mistake distribution of rewards will be completed through depositToken and the users are not able to withdraw their funds from the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the code review, It has been noticed that There is no check If the rewardToken and depositToken are same. During the initialization, If the deployer makes a mistake distribution of rewards will be completed through depositToken and the users are not able to withdraw their funds from the system.

## Impact

Users could not withdraw their tokens from the contract.

```solidity
    function __BasePool_init(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _depositToken,
        address _rewardToken,
        address _escrowPool,
        uint256 _escrowPortion,
        uint256 _escrowDuration
    ) internal onlyInitializing {
        __ERC20Permit_init(_name); // only initializes ERC712Permit
        __ERC20_init(_name, _symbol); // unchained or not it only saves the variables
        __AbstractRewards_init(balanceOf, totalSupply);
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());
        __AccessControlEnumerable_init();

        if (_escrowPortion > 1e18) {
            revert MoreThanOneError();
        }
        if (_depositToken == address(0)) {
            revert NoDepositTokenError();
        }
        depositToken = IERC20(_depositToken);
        rewardToken = IERC20(_rewardToken);
        escrowPool = ITimeLockPool(_escrowPool);
        escrowPortion = _escrowPortion;
        escrowDuration = _escrowDuration;

        if(_rewardToken != address(0) && _escrowPool != address(0)) {
            IERC20(_rewardToken).safeApprove(_escrowPool, type(uint256).max);
        }
    }
```
