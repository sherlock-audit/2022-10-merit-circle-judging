# Share can be minted to address(0) in TimeLockPool.sol#Deposit

## Summary

Share can be minted to address(0) in TimeLockPool.sol#Deposit

## Vulnerability Detail

When calling the the function deposit

```solidity
   function deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _duration, address _receiver) external override {
        if (_amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmountError();
        }
```

The function does not verify if the _receiver address is address(0),

When the mint is called, the share that minted to address(0) is basically equal to burn the share.

```solidity
    _mint(_receiver, mintAmount);
```

## Impact

Burning the share while deposit the token basically waste storage space and erode other user's share because address(0) is not supposed to get any reward anyway.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project check if the receiverAddress is address(0)

```solidity
   function deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _duration, address _receiver) external override {
        if(_receiver == address(0)) {
             revert InvalidReceiver();
        }
        if (_amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmountError();
        }
```
