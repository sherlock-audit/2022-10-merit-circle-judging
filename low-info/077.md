# Upgradable contract should have a gap on the end

## Summary
If the point of proxies is to have upgradable contracts, the contract should have a gap on the end. If not when upgrading and adding new variables, storage will get mixed up and can override existing values.

## Impact
Storage variables can get overwritten upon contract upgrading.
