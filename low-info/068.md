# Unlimited loop processing

## Summary
Loops with no upper limit set can cause a revert due to lack of gas, or exceed the gas limit of the block, making it impossible to execute the function.
## Vulnerability Detail
`getTotalDeposit(address _account)` loops through the number of deposits associated with the account.
There is no limit to the number of these deposits set, which can cause revert due to insufficient gas or exceeding the block gas limit.
## Impact
Gas fees are lost or functions cannot be performed.
