# Use OZ's MulticallUpgradeable instead of BoringBatchable

## Summary
`BoringBatchable`'s `batch()` is `payable`, allowing a double spend on `msg.value` should any contract inherit have payable functions.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the comment in the `BoringBatchable` contract, one should be aware of a vulnerability with having batchable actions with payable functions. Thankfully, none of the inherited contracts have payable functions, so it's fine for now.

## Impact
None. Informational.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider switching to OpenZeppelin's `MulticallUpgradeable` contract instead, since it provides the same functionality whilst excluding this potential vector. Alternatively, remove the `payable` keyword in the `batch` function.
