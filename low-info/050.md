# There is possibility that leave a contract "uninitialized" and that contract will be used for malicious attack

## Summary
- The vulnerability is leaving the implementation contract `uninitialized` , which allows a malicious attacker to call `initialize()` function to upgrade the implementation contract. That allow malicious attacker to upgrade malicious contract as a new implementation contract and steal fund locked in contract by executing bad functions.  

<br>

## Vulnerability Detail
- The vulnerability is leaving the implementation contract (ex. [TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol)) `uninitialized` , which allows a malicious attacker to call `initialize()` function to upgrade the implementation contract. As a result, an attacker can insert any attack contract that includes bad functionalities into a parameter of new implementation contract. Then, once an attacker is successful to update the implementation contract, they can execute the bad functions.

<br>

## Impact
- A malicious attacker can steal fund locked in contract by executing bad functions such as a function that withdraw all locked fund, etc.

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol#L6-L20
```solidity
contract TimeLockNonTransferablePool is TimeLockPool {
    function initialize(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _depositToken,
        address _rewardToken,
        address _escrowPool,
        uint256 _escrowPortion,
        uint256 _escrowDuration,
        uint256 _maxBonus,
        uint256 _maxLockDuration,
        uint256[] memory _curve
    ) public initializer {
        __TimeLockPool_init(_name, _symbol, _depositToken, _rewardToken, _escrowPool, _escrowPortion, _escrowDuration, _maxBonus, _maxLockDuration, _curve);
    }
```

## Tool used
- Manual Review

<br>

## Recommendation
- To avoid leaving a contract uninitialized, you should invoke the [_disableInitializers()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-_disableInitializers--) function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
   
<br>

- For example, in the TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol, [_disableInitializers()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-_disableInitializers--) should be added with constructor like below.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockNonTransferablePool.sol#L6-L20
```solidity
contract TimeLockNonTransferablePool is TimeLockPool {

    //@dev - _disableInitializers() should be added to avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }

    function initialize(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _depositToken,
        address _rewardToken,
        address _escrowPool,
        uint256 _escrowPortion,
        uint256 _escrowDuration,
        uint256 _maxBonus,
        uint256 _maxLockDuration,
        uint256[] memory _curve
    ) public initializer {
        __TimeLockPool_init(_name, _symbol, _depositToken, _rewardToken, _escrowPool, _escrowPortion, _escrowDuration, _maxBonus, _maxLockDuration, _curve);
    }
```
