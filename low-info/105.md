# RETURN VALUES OF TRANSFER()/TRANSFERFROM() NOT CHECKED

 RETURN VALUES OF TRANSFER()/TRANSFERFROM() NOT CHECKED
Not all IERC20 implementations revert() when thereâ€™s a failure in transfer()/transferFrom(). The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment
