# TimeLockPool withdraw() _receiver need 0 address check

## Summary

If the user mistakenly input `address(0)` as the `_receiver`, the token will be lost forever.


## Vulnerability Detail

There is no 0 address check in `withdraw()`, as a result, the `depositToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, userDeposit.amount)` might mistakenly send the token to `address(0)` and lose the token.

## Impact

Some token might be lost forever.
