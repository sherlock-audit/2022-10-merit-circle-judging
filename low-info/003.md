# The maxLockDuration parameter in TimeLockPool.sol does not have upper bound limit and does not conform to the 48 month maximum staking period business requirement.

## Summary

The maxLockDuration parameter in TimeLockPool.sol does not have upper bound limit and does not conform to the 48 month maximum staking period business requirement.

## Vulnerability Detail

the parameter maxLockDuration determines the maximum length of period that user can stake. 

```solidity
uint256 public maxLockDuration;
```

and 

```solidity
maxLockDuration = _maxLockDuration;
```

Then in deposit and this parameter is used to enforce the max lock period

In the function deposit

```solidity
// Don't allow locking > maxLockDuration
 uint256 duration = _duration.min(maxLockDuration);
```

and in the function extendLock

```solidity
 // New duration is the time expiration plus the increase
 uint256 duration = maxLockDuration.min(uint256(userDeposit.end - block.timestamp) + increaseDuration);
```

according to the documentation

> Merit Circle Staking V2 is a module where holders of MC or MC/ETH LP tokens can lock their tokens up to 48 months to get rewards.

This business requirement is not implemented by adding a upper limit bound for the parameter maxLockDuration.

## Impact

A Compromise admin can set the maxLockDuration to a very very very large number and stake a small amount token with a very large duration to collect reward.

The User is able to stake more than 48 month, which violates the business requirement.

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add a upper limit bound for the parameter maxLockDuration
