# Duration overflow

## Summary
Since _duration's upper limit maxLockDuration is uint256, casting it to uint(64) can result in overflow and saving the wrong duration in depositsOf.

## Impact
Overflow can cause the wrong duration to be saved in the storage and consequentially wrong balance.

## Tool used
VS code and me

## Recommendation
Add a condition which checks that uint64(block.timestamp) + duration <= type(uint64).max
