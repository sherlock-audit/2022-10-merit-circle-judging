# pointsPerShare is not scaled once shares have been minted (deposit) or burned (withdraw)

## Summary
pointsPerShare is not scaled once shares have been burned

## Vulnerability Detail

Burning reduces total supply. For example, in beginning, there is a total of 1000 shares, and 1000 rewards have been distributed (1 / share) but suddenly 900 shares have been burned. A total of 100 shares remaining each share get 1 reward, only maximum of 100 rewards can be claimed. The remaining 900 will be wasted.

On the other hand, for minting, For example, in beginning, there is a total of 100 shares, and 100 rewards have been distributed (1 / share) but suddenly 900 shares have been minted. A total of 1000 shares remaining each share gets 1 reward. You need to have 1000 rewards in the contract, but only 100 rewards is actually in the contract.

## Impact
Some rewards will be wasted forever if too many burns. And it won't be a sufficient reward if new shares get minted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please take a look at any Masterchef implementation such as https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-farm/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol

1. Add reward debt system
2. Automatically claim the reward on each deposit and withdraw.
3. Automatically update reward debt on each deposit and withdraw.

Reward debt is not like withdrawnRewards tracking, it uses current balance * pointsPerShare instead.
