# Burning should be done if we deploy `_mint`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
If we `_mint` some coins or Token or certain Amount we should have burning process .Since burning is a process where the miners and developers remove the coins from circulation. In other words, coin burn is a process of destroying the coin so that it is not available for further use (trading or otherwise). The developers and miners will send the coins to the specialised addresses whose private keys are not accessible. Further, they should provide the proof-of-burn algorithm to the market to facilitate cross verification.
Now this was a certain using principle of burning and minting but how does it help in this contract . What I am basically trying to do is the contract should always have a burning statement if we deploy certain mint condition but if we do not deploy the burn statement then anybody can access those previous amount and can crash the chain .

## Code Snippet
https://github.dev/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L105
```
  function deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _duration, address _receiver) external override {
        if (_amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmountError();
        }
        // Don't allow locking > maxLockDuration
        uint256 duration = _duration.min(maxLockDuration);
        // Enforce min lockup duration to prevent flash loan or MEV transaction ordering
        duration = duration.max(MIN_LOCK_DURATION);

        depositToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);

        uint256 mintAmount = _amount * getMultiplier(duration) / 1e18;

        depositsOf[_receiver].push(Deposit({
            amount: _amount,
            shareAmount: mintAmount,
            start: uint64(block.timestamp),
            end: uint64(block.timestamp) + uint64(duration)
        }));

        _mint(_receiver, mintAmount);
        emit Deposited(_amount, duration, _receiver, _msgSender());
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Burning statement should be deployed for these two functions.
