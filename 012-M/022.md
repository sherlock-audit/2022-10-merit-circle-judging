# Consider adding minAmount to extendLock/increaseLock/deposit for slippage control

## Summary
Consider adding minAmount to extendLock/increaseLock/deposit for slippage control
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no minimum limit to the number of tokens that are minted (or burned) in the extendLock/increaseLock/deposit functions, which may result in the user receiving less tokens than expected if the transactions calling these functions occur in the same block as the transactions calling the setCurvePoint/setCurve functions.
## Impact
This may result in the user receiving less tokens than expected.
