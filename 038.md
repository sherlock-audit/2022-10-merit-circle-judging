# Front-runnable Initializers

## Summary

All contract **initializers** were missing access controls, allowing any user to initialize the contract. By front-running the contract deployers to initialize the contract, the incorrect parameters may be supplied, leaving the contract needing to be redeployed.

## Recommendation

While the code that can be run in contract constructors is limited, setting the owner in the contract's constructor to the `msg.sender` and adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to all **initializers** would be a sufficient level of access control.
