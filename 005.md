# Incompatability with deflationary / fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

When depositing and withdrawing, if the token is a fee-on-transfer tokens, the internal accounting will have issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

when depositing, we call

```solidity
   depositToken.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
   uint256 mintAmount = _amount * getMultiplier(duration) / 1e18;
```

We assume that the _amount will passed accurately transferred into the TimeLockPool.sol,

however, if the underlying token is fee-on-transfer token, for example, we transfer 100 token, but when transfering, the token charge a fee and 95 Token is what the contract receive,

the contract will still use the 100 balance to mint share, which is not accurate.

When withdraw, we call

```solidity
        // burn pool shares
        _burn(_msgSender(), userDeposit.shareAmount);
        
        // return tokens
        depositToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, userDeposit.amount);
```

However, if the underlying token is rebasing, the TimeLockContract have more token balance then the user deposit, then the rebased token balance will be lost because we just withdraw userDeposit.amount

## Impact

In Deposit, the amount of share minted is not accurate because the amount we intended to receive can be difficult from the amount we received.

In Withdraw, user may lose the rebasing amount of token.

## Recommendation

Consider compare pre-/after token balances to compute the actual transferred amount.
