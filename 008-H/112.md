# User will Lose Rewards by `extendLock()` of `TimeLockPool.sol`

## Summary
User can specify `_increaseDuration` parameter to extend lock time of their already locked deposit to gain further rewards.
However this is not extending but more of an overwritting since all of the `userDeposit.shareAmount` that was minted
when user first deposited will be lost when calling this `extendLock()`, if user didn't claim the rewards by calling `claimRewards`
beforehand of calling this `extendLock()` function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User deposited `depositToken` and set its duration as 12 month and gained corresponding `shareAmount` 
2. After 11 month, user decided to extend duration for 6 more month so called `extendLock()` with `_increaseDuration` parameter set as 6 month
3. When this is called, user will lose 11 month worth of `shareAmount` token

## Impact
User will lose rewards they deposited by calling `extendLock()` of `TimeLockPool.sol`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `extendLock()` functionality so that it will add new `shareAmount` calculated on top of initial `shareAmount`, instead of burning the initial `shareAmount`.
