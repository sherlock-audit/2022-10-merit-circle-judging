# Disincentive to extend lock because shares are burnt

## Summary
`extendLock()` is beneficial for the protocol, but it potentially punishes the user for doing so because the new shares can potentially be less than his current one.

## Vulnerability Detail
When extending the lock duration, it's possible for the amount of new shares to be less than that of the current shares amount, due to multiple factors such as:
- New extended lock duration < original lock duration (Eg. extend 6 months at close to end of original lock duration of 2 years)
- Reduced multipliers since original lockup

While locking up the deposited tokens is deemed to be a gain for the protocol, the user actually gets punished as his shares are burnt. He is better off not taking any action (nearer release date + more shares).

## Impact
User loses his shares for extending the lock duration, goes WTF and complains to customer support.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert if the amount of new shares is less than the current shares held by the user instead of performing a burn.
