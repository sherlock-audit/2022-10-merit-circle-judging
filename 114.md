# User will loose rewards during re-staking

## Summary

`withdrawnRewards[_account]` is used to keep track of the amount of rewards users have withdrawn.
But the value is not reset between staking, so a user staking again using the same address will loose rewards.

## Impact

If a user re-stakes, `withdrawableRewardsOf` will revert till reward amount is lesser than the previous recorded reward amount, and when `cumulativeRewardsOf(_account) > withdrawnRewards[_account]`, the user will receive lesser rewards. 
And since the user deposit is timelocked, the user cannot withdraw the deposit till the end of the duration.
