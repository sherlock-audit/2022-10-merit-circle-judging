# User might lose funds on extending lock

## Summary
While extending lock, if the resulting mintAmount becomes lesser than userDeposit.shareAmount (due to varying Multiplier curve) then user own deposit are burned which means user loses funds for extending duration which is wrong

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User had a deposit of amount 100 for duration X which gave him mint Amount of 50
2. After some time, User wants to extend duration by y ie new duration should be X+y using [extendLock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L148)
3. Due to varying Multiplier curve, the extendLock function resulted in new mint Amount of 40 with the duration X+y
4. Since the new mint Amount of 40 is lesser than userDeposit.shareAmount so user deposit are burned which does not make sense since user is penalized for keeping his funds locked for more duration (instead he should be rewarded for locking amount)

```python
function extendLock(uint256 _depositId, uint256 _increaseDuration) external {
else if (mintAmount < userDeposit.shareAmount) {
            depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount =  mintAmount;
            _burn(_msgSender(), userDeposit.shareAmount - mintAmount);
        }
}
```

## Impact
User will lose there funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert if mintAmount < userDeposit.shareAmount so that user is prevented from loss. In this case it is advisable for user to start a new deposit
