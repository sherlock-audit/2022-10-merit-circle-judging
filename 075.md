# Deposit ids get mixed up upon withdrawal

## Summary
When withdrawing, depositIds get mixed up, so when a user wants to withdraw next time or extendLock, he will do so on the wrong deposit.

## Impact
User will interact with the wrong deposit since the id will change upon withdrawal of another.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/Merit-Circle/merit-liquidity-mining/blob/ce5feaae19126079d309ac8dd9a81372648437f1/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L126

## Tool used
VS code and me

## Recommendation
Might be better to just delete the deposit and leave the rest as is.
