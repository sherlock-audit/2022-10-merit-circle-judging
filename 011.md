# A mistake made by depositer will result into losing his funds, which will be stuck in the pool.

## Summary
A mistake made by the depositer will result into losing his funds, which will be stuck in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:
Kiki wants to lock his funds and calls the function `deposit()`. He locks his 5000 tokens for the duration of 2 weeks and provides his address as the "_receiver".

By calling the function `deposit()`:
1.The tokens will be transferred from Kiki to the pool.
2.The `mintAmount` will be calculated
3.Kiki's deposit information will be stored into a new Deposit struct in the depositOf mapping.
4.After that the function will mint the corresponding shares for the given amount of tokens to Kiki.

Later Kiki decides that he wants to lock another 1000 of his tokens. Instead of calling the function `increaseLock()`, he mades the mistake and calls the function `deposit()` again. This time he provides the amount of 1000 tokens and the same duration of 2 weeks.

The function will push the new deposit information to the already existing Deposit struct from the first deposit Kiki made. 
However the problem here is that the function will change the  `amount of 5000 tokens from the first deposit` with the new deposit of 1000 tokens and won't actually sum both of the amounts. 
Same happens for the shares as well, `the old "shareAmount" corresponding the amount of 5000 tokens` will be replaced with the new shares from the second deposited amount of 1000 tokens.

2 weeks later when Kiki calls the function `withdraw()` to withdraw his tokens. The function will delete Kiki's Deposit struct, will burn the shares and return the tokens. However duo to the fact that `userDeposit.shareAmount` and `userDeposit.amount` will be equal to the 1000 tokens from the second deposit Kiki made. The function will successfuly return only the 1000 tokens to Kiki. 
But his other 5000 tokens from the first deposit he made, will be stuck in the pool.

Kiki won't be able to withdraw his first deposit of 5000 tokens.
Because the function `withdraw()` checks the deposit information from the Kiki's Deposit struct 
and both `userDeposit.amount` and `userDeposit.shareAmount` will be equal to the second deposit Kiki made for 1000 tokens.

Duo to the fact that the `deposit()` function minted shares for both of the deposits Kiki made, and only the shares of the second deposit were burned corresponding the 1000 tokens. Kiki won't only lose his first deposit of 5000 tokens, but won't even get the chance to claim the full amount of rewards, he will be able to claim the rewards only for the burned amount of shares corresponding the 1000 tokens.

Simple mistake led to Kiki's losing 5000 tokens out of the 6000 tokens he deposited into the pool from the two deposits.
And by following this scenario his 5000 tokens will be stuck in the pool without a way for retrieving them back.

## Impact
Duo to the exploit described in "Vulnerability Detail", a simple mistake made by the depositer will lead to losing his funds, which will be stuck in the pool.
