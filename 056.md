# Misconfigured pool can lead to rewards locked indefinitely

## Summary
Due to weak validation of the BasePool initialization function ([__BasePool_init](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BasePool.sol#L48)) it's possible to deploy a pool with a misconfigured escrow pool: `escrowPool` can be set to the zero address while `escrowPortion` is set to a valid value. In such a pool, depositors will get only a portion of reward tokens (as per `escrowPortion`) and the remaining part will remain locked in the pool and unclaimable indefinitely.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause is in [these lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BasePool.sol#L102-L107):
```solidity
function claimRewards(address _receiver) external {
    uint256 rewardAmount = _prepareCollect(_msgSender());
    // @audit escrow amount is extracted before escrow pool configuration is validated
    uint256 escrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount * escrowPortion / 1e18;
    uint256 nonEscrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount - escrowedRewardAmount;

    if(escrowedRewardAmount != 0 && address(escrowPool) != address(0)) {
        escrowPool.deposit(escrowedRewardAmount, escrowDuration, _receiver);
    }

    // ignore dust
    if(nonEscrowedRewardAmount > 1) {
        rewardToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
    }
    ...
}
```
Here, `rewardAmount` is split into `escrowedRewardAmount` and `nonEscrowedRewardAmount` before the check for configured escrow pool is made. In case `escrowedRewardAmount` is non-zero and `escrowPool` is the zero address:
1. `escrowedRewardAmount` will be subtracted from `rewardAmount`;
1. `escrowedRewardAmount` won't be sent to `escrowPool` because it's not configured;
1. the user will get only `nonEscrowedRewardAmount`;
1. `escrowedRewardAmount` will remain unclaimable.
## Impact
Reward tokens that are expected to be distributed among users pro-rata get locked in a misconfigured pool indefinitely.
## Code Snippet
```javascript
// test/BasePool.ts
it("locks funds when escrow is misconfigured [audit]", async () => {
    const testBasePoolFactory = new TestBasePool__factory(deployer);

    const DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT = parseEther("1");
    const MINT_AMOUNT = parseEther("10");

    // Deploying a misconfigured pool...
    const basePool = (await testBasePoolFactory.deploy(
        TOKEN_NAME,
        TOKEN_SYMBOL,
        depositToken.address,
        rewardToken.address,
        constants.AddressZero, // escrowPool is not set
        constants.WeiPerEther.div(2), // escrowPortion is set to 50%
        ESCROW_DURATION
    )).connect(account1);

    await rewardToken.approve(basePool.address, constants.MaxUint256);

    // account3 is the only depositor, thus it's eligible for the entire DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT.
    await basePool.mint(account1.address, MINT_AMOUNT);
    await basePool.distributeRewards(DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT);
    await basePool.claimRewards(account3.address);

    // account3 receives only half of the distribution amount.
    expect(await rewardToken.balanceOf(account3.address)).to.eq(DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT.div(2));
    // account3 cannot claim more tokens.
    expect(await basePool.withdrawableRewardsOf(account3.address)).to.eq(0);
    // The pool keeps holding the remaining distribution amount indefinitely, and it's not claimable by anyone.
    expect(await rewardToken.balanceOf(basePool.address)).to.eq(DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT.div(2));
    // escrowPool gets nothing because it's not configured.
    expect(await escrowPool.getTotalDeposit(account3.address)).to.eq(0);
});
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider extracting escrow reward amount only if the escrow pool is configured properly (both `escrowPool` and `escrowPortion` are set to valid values).
