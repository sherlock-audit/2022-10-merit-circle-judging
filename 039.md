# Unsafe cast on point correction calculations

## Summary
Unsafe cast may lead to wrong results.
## Vulnerability Detail
Every time an accaunt's shares are minted or burned, there is a point correction calculation for the account, which involves `uint256 pointsPerShare`. To do the needed multiplication **shares * pointsPerShare**, we have to cast all operands to same type.
In function `_correctPoints()`  shares represented as `int256 _shares`. 
So we need to cast `uint256 pointsPerShare` to `int256`. 
The way it is done: `int256(pointsPerShare)` will lead to problems when `pointsPerShare` become > `type(int256).max`
## Impact
Unsafe cast will lead `pointsPerShare` to have some negative value in scope of this calculation, which will lead to wrong value for `pointsCorrection[_account]` to be stored, and as result wrong amount of rewards distributed to the account.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/AbstractRewards.sol
125:   function _correctPoints(address _account, int256 _shares) internal {
126:     pointsCorrection[_account] = pointsCorrection[_account] + (_shares * (int256(pointsPerShare)));
127:   }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `SafeCast` library to safely cast the `uint256` to `int256`
```diff
function _correctPoints(address _account, int256 _shares) internal {
-  pointsCorrection[_account] = pointsCorrection[_account] + (_shares * (int256(pointsPerShare)));
+  pointsCorrection[_account] = pointsCorrection[_account] + (_shares * pointsPerShare.toInt256());
  }
```
