# User loss previous amount

## Summary
On extending the lock, user will lose all the amount which he has gathered before calling the extendLock function. This is happening due to an incorrect logic

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User has deposited amount 200 for duration 20 seconds for which mint amount was 100
2. Post 10 seconds user decides to use [extendLock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L148) function to extend by further 5 seconds
3. This makes the duration as below

```python
uint256 duration = maxLockDuration.min(uint256(userDeposit.end - block.timestamp) + increaseDuration);
// duration = maxLockDuration.min(20-10)+5)=15

uint256 mintAmount = userDeposit.amount * getMultiplier(duration) / 1e18;
// 200*getMultiplier(15)/1e18 = 60

depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount =  mintAmount;
//depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount =  60 
```

4. So new mint Amount came become 60 and old was 100. But this mint Amount was calculated for last 15 seconds which does not care of mint Amount from initial 10 seconds. The mint Amount of 100-60=40 which user for for the past 10 seconds should be withdrawn to user account

## Impact
User will lose funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the calculation as shown (or simply withdraw the difference mint amount):

```python
uint256 duration = maxLockDuration.min(increaseDuration);
...
if (mintAmount > userDeposit.shareAmount) {
            depositsOf[_msgSender()][_depositId].shareAmount+ =  mintAmount;
            _mint(_msgSender(), mintAmount);
        }
...
```
