# Unlimited minting and burning is possible through TestBasePool.sol

## Summary
External Contracts can directly call BasePool.mint() through TestBasePool.sol. 
## Vulnerability Detail
TestBasePool.sol#L40-46
```
function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) external { 
        _mint(_receiver, _amount);
    }

function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external { 
        _burn(_from, _amount);
    }
```
TestBasePool inherits BasePool.sol without an auth check, allowing an external contract to directly call _mint  and _burn without having to deposit any tokens. 
## Impact
A malicious user can arbitrarily mint shares as well as burn users' shares causing economic loss
