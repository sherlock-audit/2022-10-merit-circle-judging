# A malicious address with the onlyGov role can have full access to the contract storage

## Summary
A malicious address with the onlyGov role can call `setCurve()` and `setCurvePoint()`. These 2 are exploitable functions when used together as it allows arbitrary changing of storage slot values.

## Vulnerability Detail
`curve[]` is a dynamic array. The position slot is at `keccak256(p)`, where p is the originally defined storage slot based on the layout of state variables. `setCurve()` can in theory be used to expand the length of the curve to `uint256.max`. With a max length `curve[]` array, we can update any value at any storage slot we want with `setCurvePoint()` as it makes the update `curve[_position] = _newPoint`, where `_position` and `_newPoint` are arbitrary values we can set.

For example, if we want to change the value at storage slot 0, we calculate position `x` such that `keccak256(p) + x = 0 % uint256.max`

## Impact
Malicious address can have full access to the storage slot and can basically change any variables it wants to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a mapping instead of array for `curve[]` to avoid this problem since the storage of a map is not sequential so malicious attacker cannot determine the exact position of a specific storage slot.
