# Curve is not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing

## Summary
`getMultiplier()` fails if the curve is not monotonically increasing. However, this condition is not enforced.

## Vulnerability Detail
Subtraction overflow is encountered in `getMultiplier()` when `curve[n + 1]` < `curve[n]`.

```solidity
return 1e18 + curve[n] + (_lockDuration - n * unit) * (curve[n + 1] - curve[n]) / unit;
```

## Impact
Attempts to deposit, increase lock duration or amount may revert.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When setting a new curve or a new point, the monotonic increase condition should be checked.
