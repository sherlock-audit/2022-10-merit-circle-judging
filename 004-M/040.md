# Curve mess up is posssible that leads to deposit function blocked

## Summary
It's possible that the multiplier for deposited tokens will be calculated incorrectly when curves values are not validated and will be not possible to deposit.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits token then some multiplier is calculated to know the amount of share tokens to be minted. This multiplier is calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L233-L246) and it uses state variable `curve` inside. 

It's possible that curve values will be provided in wrong order, because there is no validation nor in the [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L51-L59) nor in the [setter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L280-L311) that `curve[i+1] > curve[i]`. There is only check that `curve[i]` is not bigger than `maxBonus`.

In case if `curve[i+1] > curve[i]` then this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L245) in multiplier calculation function will revert with underflow error.
So depositing is not possible anymore.
## Impact
Calculation of share tokens can be broken.

## Recommendation
Do validation of curve array elements, so `curve[i+1] > curve[i]`.
