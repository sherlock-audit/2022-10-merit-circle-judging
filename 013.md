# Ability to enjoy max benefits while only being locked for the minimum duration

## Summary

The `increaseLock()` function of the `TimeLockPool` is using the wrong deposit to verify whether the deposit has been ended and to calculate the remaining duration.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `increaseLock()` function of the `TimeLockPool` contract verifies the remaining duration and whether the deposit has been expired on the depositId linked to the msg.sender. While on the other hand, the amount of deposit tokens and share amount is increased on the depositId linked to the receiver.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability as follows:

1. Create a new lock A with a very small amount and `maxLockDuration` from account A
2. Create a new lock B (or use an existing one) with an arbitrary amount and *`MIN_LOCK_DURATION`* (10 minutes) from account B.
3. Ensure the `depositId` of both locks are the same. This could be done by creating/deleting arbitrary locks until the amount of depositâ€™s of account A and B are the same.
4. Call the `increaseLock` function from the account linked to lock A with a large `_increaseAmount` and address of account B as `_receiver`
5. Lock B (with the small lock duration) will be increased with the `_increaseAmount` and a bonus of shares multiplied by 5 (due to the `maxLockDuration` of lock A). 
6. The attacker benefits from the 500% multiplier benefits while only having to lock their assets for a minimum of 10 minutes.

## Recommendation

Assign the `userDeposit` to the `_depositId` linked to the `_receiver` instead of `_msgSender()` as follows:

```Solidity
Deposit memory userDeposit = depositsOf[_receiver][_depositId];
```
