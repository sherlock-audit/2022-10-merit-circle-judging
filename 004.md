# User will lose their ETH if they call the batch function in BoringBatch.sol with ETH sent

## Summary

User will lose their ETH if they call the batch function in BoringBatch.sol with ETH sent

## Vulnerability Detail

The boring batch has a batch function to let user execute function in batch by constructing the calldata, 

```solidity
    function batch(bytes[] calldata calls, bool revertOnFail) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(calls[i]);
            if (!success && revertOnFail) {
                revert(_getRevertMsg(result));
            }
        }
    }
```

However, this function is payable and accept ETH, but there is no function in the construct that let we withdraw ETH, then ETH sent from user will be forever lost and stuck in the contract.

## Impact

User can accidentally lose their ETH when calling BoringBatch.sol#Batch

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project make this function not payable. Also I do not see why a delegatecall must be performed here,

we can change to

```solidity
    function batch(bytes[] calldata calls) external  {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).call(calls[i]);
            require(success, 'failed');
        }
    }
```
