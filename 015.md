# Low level call returns true if the address doesn't exist

## Summary
As written in the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), the low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The low-level function delegatecall are used in some places in the code and it can be problematic.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/base/BoringBatchable.sol#L33-L38

      '   function batch(bytes[] calldata calls, bool revertOnFail) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(calls[i]);
            if (!success && revertOnFail) {
                revert(_getRevertMsg(result));
            }'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check before any low-level call that the address actually exists, for example before the low-level call in the callERC20 function you can check that the address is a contract by checking its code size.
