# Rewards might be lost due to rounding down error

## Summary

When the total share is big `_amount * POINTS_MULTIPLIER / shares` could round down to 0, as a result, `pointPerShare` would remain the same but the reward `_amount` is transferred, this portion of rewards will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the shares grow large enough compared to `POINTS_MULTIPLIER`, `_amount * POINTS_MULTIPLIER / shares` could round down to 0. Even not 0, if shares is just above half of `POINTS_MULTIPLIER`, the rounding error can still make the user receive in-proportional `pointPerShare`. In case `_amount` is 1, and shares is (type(uint128).max / 2 + 1), then, the resultant `pointPerShare` would be only half compared to the value it should be.

## Impact

The user might lose the reward `_amount`, but receive 0 or in-proportional `pointPerShare`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add checks to make sure `pointPerShare` will be increased.
```solidity
    require(_amount * POINTS_MULTIPLIER / shares > 0);
```
