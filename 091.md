# A miner can manipulate the block timestamp which can be used to their advantage to attack a smart contract via Block Timestamp Manipulation

 USE OF BLOCK.TIMESTAMP 

## Summary
A miner can manipulate the block timestamp which can be used to their advantage to attack a smart contract via Block Timestamp Manipulation

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/Merit-Circle/merit-liquidity-mining/blob/ce5feaae19126079d309ac8dd9a81372648437f1/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol


block.timestamp is being used several times




Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.

Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbersâ€”i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.

Time-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts (time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry dates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with a 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks. Thus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can be more secure, as miners are unable to easily manipulate the block number.


## Impact
Dishonest  Miners can influence the value of block.timestamp to perform Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks.
The use of now creates a risk that time manipulation can be performed to manipulate price oracles. Miners can modify the timestamp by up to 900 seconds , Usually to an extent of few seconds on Ethereum, or generally few percent of the block time on any EVM-compatible PoW network.



## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use block.number instead of  block.timestamp or now to reduce the risk of
MEV attacks
