# setCurvePoint: unit not updated when curve.length changes

## Summary
When `curve.length` changes in `setCurvePoint`, `unit` is not updated, leading to wrong calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
`unit` is per definition `maxLockDuration / (curve.length - 1)` and when `curve.length` changes, it should therefore be recalculated (which is done in `setCurve`). However, the length of the `curve` array can also change in `setCurvePoint` (increase or decrease) and `unit` is not recalculated in these cases.

## Impact
`getMultiplier` will return wrong values (a multiplier that is too high or low, which causes a financial loss / unexpected financial gain for users) and even not work at all in certain scenarios. For instance, it can happen that `uint n = _lockDuration / unit > curve.length - 1`, which causes the function to revert (because an out-of-bounds array access).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recalculate `unit` when the length of `curve` changes.
