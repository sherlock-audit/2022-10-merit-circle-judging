# increaseLock can be used to circumvent MIN_LOCK_DURATION

## Summary
The `increaseLock` function can be used to circumvent the minimum lock duration that is normally enforced.

## Vulnerability Detail
Normally, all locks need to have a duration that is greater than `MIN_LOCK_DURATION`. However, a user can call `increaseLock` just before the end time to essentially have locks with arbitrary small times. On the first deposit (where the duration is enforced), he could only deposit 1 wei and then increase it by 10^20 wei just before the end.

## Impact
This circumvents a security measure of the system and allows attackers to gain a significant share with very short-term loans, which should not be possible. For instance, with a loan of just 12 seconds (1 block), someone could mint the majority of the tokens for him.
