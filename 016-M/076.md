# IncreaseLock() should check MIN_LOCK_DURATION

## Summary
If there is a MIN_LOCK_DURATION increaseLock should not be allowed, since user can add more amount and lock it for less than MIN_LOCK_DURATION. 

## Impact
Code will not work as intended if this condition does not exist and users can lock funds for arbitrary amount of time using existing locks.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/Merit-Circle/merit-liquidity-mining/blob/ce5feaae19126079d309ac8dd9a81372648437f1/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L197

## Tool used
VS code and me

## Recommendation
Add a condition, that when increaseLock is called, the remainingDuration > MIN_LOCK_DURATION.
