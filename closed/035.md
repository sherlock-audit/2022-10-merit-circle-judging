# Prevent reentrancy

## Summary
A reentrancy attack can be performed if the reward token is updated to be an ERC777 token.

## Impact
Low 
## Vulnerability Detail
A lack of reentrancy preventions allow users to reenter relevant protocol functions, such as `claimRewards()` in BasePool.sol, or `withdraw()` in TimeLockPool.sol . 
If the reward token is updated to be an ERC777 token in the future (which has support for hooks), a malicious party could re-enter the function that performed the token transfer by calling the function transferring the tokens again in the ERC777 hook.
Especially in `claimRewards()`, where users obtain the rewards corresponding to their staking amount, the transfer could call a callback triggering an attacker's malicious contract function where `claimRewards()` could be called again.
## Code Snippet

```
function claimRewards(address _receiver) external {
        uint256 rewardAmount = _prepareCollect(_msgSender());
        uint256 escrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount * escrowPortion / 1e18;
        uint256 nonEscrowedRewardAmount = rewardAmount - escrowedRewardAmount;

        if(escrowedRewardAmount != 0 && address(escrowPool) != address(0)) {
            escrowPool.deposit(escrowedRewardAmount, escrowDuration, _receiver);
        }
        // ignore dust
        if(nonEscrowedRewardAmount > 1) {
            rewardToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
        }
        emit RewardsClaimed(_msgSender(), _receiver, escrowedRewardAmount, nonEscrowedRewardAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add reentrancy guards to functions transferring reward tokens back from the protocol (`claimRewards()` in BasePool.sol, or `withdraw()` in TimeLockPool.sol) (see [ReentrancyGuard.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol))
