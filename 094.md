# If the first curve value is set to be non-zero, an attacker can drain protocol(user) funds

## Summary

If the first curve value (the one at index 0) in `TimeLockPool.sol` is set to be zero, a malicious user can repeatedly call `deposit` and 	`withdraw` functions to drain the protocol fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L96) function is called by the user, the amount of tokens minted to the user is directly proportional to the return value of [getMultiplier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L245) function.

```solidity
return 1e18 + curve[n] + (_lockDuration - n * unit) * (curve[n + 1] - curve[n]) / unit;
```

If the _lockDuration argument is small, then n will be zero as per [line 238](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-merit-circle/blob/main/merit-liquidity-mining/contracts/TimeLockPool.sol#L238)
Which means the return statement can be simplified to:
```solidity
return 1e18 + curve[0] + _lockDuration * (curve[1] - curve[0]) / unit;
```

This means that even if the user deposit tokens for only `MIN_LOCK_DURATION ` (which is like 10 mins), he will get the full benefit of being in the whole first segment (segment belonging to curve index from 0 to 1) of curve. He can simply `withdraw` the funds and again do rinse and repeat. 

## Impact

When exploited, the protocol will send more tokens to the malicious user than he deserves. Which drains protocol funds. Indirectly draining user funds. 

## Code Snippet
**getMultiplier function:**

```solidity
    function getMultiplier(uint256 _lockDuration) public view returns(uint256) {
        // There is no need to check _lockDuration amount, it is always checked before
        // in the functions that call this function

        // n is the time unit where the lockDuration stands
        uint n = _lockDuration / unit;
        // if last point no need to interpolate
        // trim de curve if it exceedes the maxBonus // TODO check if this is needed
        if (n == curve.length - 1) {
            return 1e18 + curve[n];
        }
        // linear interpolation between points
        return 1e18 + curve[n] + (_lockDuration - n * unit) * (curve[n + 1] - curve[n]) / unit;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a `require` condition check before the curve values are set. For example we can add a `require` statement in the initialization function like this:
```solidity
        if (_curve[0] > 0) {
          revert InvalidCurveValue();
        }
```
